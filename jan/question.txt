# Clash of Code - Competition Questions

## Problem 1: Pythagorean Quads
Find all sets of four positive integers (a,b,c,d) that satisfy:
a² + b² + c² = d²
where 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100 and d ≤ 200

**Output Required:** Calculate the sum of all unique 'd' values found.

**Example:**
If we had a smaller range of 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 5:
One valid quad would be (3,4,0,5) since 3² + 4² + 0² = 25 = 5²

## Problem 2: Projectile Path Points
A projectile is launched with initial velocity v = 50 m/s at angle θ = 45°. 
Assuming g = 9.81 m/s², find how many integer coordinate points (x,y) the projectile passes through, where both x and y are positive integers.

**Equations you may need:**
- x = v₀t cos(θ)
- y = v₀t sin(θ) - (1/2)gt²
- Maximum height = v₀²sin²(θ)/2g
- Time of flight = 2v₀sin(θ)/g
- Range = v₀²sin(2θ)/g

**Output Required:** The count of integer coordinate points (x,y) the projectile passes through before hitting the ground.

## Problem 3: Prime Pattern Sum
Generate a sequence where each term is the sum of two prime numbers that add up to the term's position number.

**Rules:**
- Each position number must be represented as the sum of two prime numbers
- If multiple prime pairs exist for a position, use the pair with the smallest first prime
- Consider positions from 1 to 1000

**Example:**
- Position 4: 2+2=4
- Position 5: 2+3=5
- Position 6: 3+3=6

**Output Required:** Sum of all valid terms from position 1 to 1000

## Problem 4: Triangle Combinations
Given a set of points: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

Find:
1. Number of possible triangles with area greater than 0.5 square units
2. Number of possible triangles with at least one right angle

**Area formula:** Area = |(x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂))|/2

**Output Required:** (Number of triangles satisfying condition 1) × (Number of triangles satisfying condition 2)

## Problem 5: Series Pattern Recognition
Generate a sequence where each term follows this rule:
- If n is even: term = n × (sum of prime factors of n)
- If n is odd: term = n × (sum of all factors of n)

**Example:**
- For n=4: prime factors are 2,2 so term = 4 × (2+2) = 16
- For n=9: factors are 1,3,9 so term = 9 × (1+3+9) = 117

**Output Required:** Sum of first 100 terms in this sequence

## Competition Rules & Guidelines

1. Time Limit: 2 hours
2. Programming Languages Allowed: C, C++, Python, or Java
3. Each solution should be written in code and output the final answer
4. No external libraries or internet resources allowed
5. All solutions must handle edge cases properly
6. Code should be optimized but there are no strict time/space complexity requirements
7. Submit only the final numerical answer for each problem
8. Team members can collaborate and split tasks
9. Comment your code for clarity
10. Test your code with sample cases before submission
