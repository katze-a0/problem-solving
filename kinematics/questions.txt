Kinematics Problems
Problem 1: Multi-Ball Collision
Three balls are thrown from origin (0,0):

Ball A: 30° angle, 15 m/s velocity
Ball B: 45° angle, 20 m/s velocity
Ball C: 60° angle, 25 m/s velocity
Find the earliest time (rounded to 3 decimals) when any two balls reach the same point.
Use g = 9.81 m/s²

Problem 2: Target Practice
A target moves in a straight line:

Starting at point (10,0)
Constant velocity 5 m/s in x-direction
A ball is thrown from origin (0,0) to hit the target.
Find the initial velocity and angle (rounded to 2 decimals) that hits the target in minimum time.
Use g = 9.81 m/s²

Problem 3: Bounce and Catch
A ball is thrown upward at angle θ from point (0,0):

It bounces perfectly elastically from a wall at x=10
After bounce, it should land at point (0,0)
Find:
The angle θ (in degrees, rounded to 2 decimals)
Initial velocity (rounded to 2 decimals)
Time taken for complete journey (rounded to 2 decimals)
Use g = 9.81 m/s²
