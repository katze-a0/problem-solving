# Sequence and Series Competition Problems

## Problem 1: Arithmetic Sequence Sum with Powers
Consider an arithmetic sequence where each term is squared before being added to the sum. 
The sequence starts with a=2 and has a common difference d=3. Find the sum of the squared terms 
up to the point where any individual term (before squaring) exceeds 50.

Example for first few terms:
- First term: 2² = 4
- Second term: 5² = 25
- Third term: 8² = 64
...and so on.

## Problem 2: Geometric Sequence Pattern Match
Start with a geometric sequence where a=3 and r=2. Generate terms until you exceed 1000.
 For each term in this sequence, count how many digits in that term are even numbers. 
 Find the sum of all terms in the sequence that have exactly 2 even digits.

Example of digit counting:
- 3 has 0 even digits
- 6 has 1 even digit
- 12 has 1 even digit
- 24 has 2 even digits
...and so on.

## Problem 3: Modified Fibonacci Challenge
Create a modified Fibonacci sequence where each new term is the sum of the previous three terms
 (instead of two). Starting with 1, 2, 3, find the sum of all terms that are divisible by both 
 3 and 4 until a term exceeds 1,000,000.

Example of first few terms:
1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37...

## Problem 4: Interleaved Sequences
Consider two sequences:
- Sequence A: Arithmetic sequence starting at 2 with difference 3
- Sequence B: Geometric sequence starting at 3 with ratio 2

Create an interleaved sequence by alternating between the sequences (A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3...). 
Find the sum of all terms in this interleaved sequence that are prime numbers, until you've used the
 first 10 terms from each original sequence.

## Problem 5: Sequence with Conditions
Generate a sequence where each term is calculated as follows:
- If the previous term is even: multiply it by 3 and add 1
- If the previous term is odd: divide it by 2 (integer division)

Starting with 10, find the sum of all terms until the sequence reaches 1 or exceeds 10000 terms.

Example of first few terms:
10 → 31 → 15 → 7 → 3 → 1
