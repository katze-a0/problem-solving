# Sample Competition Questions: Permutations & Combinations

## Question 1: Password Generator
A password consists of exactly 8 characters, where:
- Each character must be either a digit (0-9) or an uppercase letter (A-Z)
- The password must contain at least 2 digits
- The digits in the password must be in strictly increasing order
- The same letter can be used multiple times

Write a program to find how many possible valid passwords exist.

Example explanation:
- A2B5C7DE is valid (digits 2,5,7 are in increasing order)
- AB12C3DE is invalid (digits 1,2,3 are not in strictly increasing order)
- ABCDEFGH is invalid (doesn't contain 2 digits)

## Question 2: Team Formation
In a class of 30 students, a team needs to be formed with the following criteria:
- The team must have exactly 5 students
- At least 2 of them must be from the Mathematics club (which has 12 members)
- At least 1 must be from the Computer Science club (which has 15 members)
- 5 students are members of both clubs
- 8 students are not in either club

Write a program to calculate the total number of different possible team combinations.

## Question 3: Circular Seating
There are N friends (N ≤ 15) who want to sit around a circular table for dinner. However:
- Alice and Bob must sit next to each other
- Charlie cannot sit next to David
- Eve must sit exactly opposite to Frank (if N is even)

Given N and the names of all friends, calculate the number of possible seating arrangements that satisfy all conditions.

Note: Rotations of the same arrangement are considered the same arrangement.

## Question 4: Color Pattern
You have unlimited tiles of 4 different colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). You need to create a line of exactly N tiles (N ≤ 20) following these rules:
- No two adjacent tiles can be of the same color
- Red tiles cannot be next to Blue tiles
- There must be at least one tile of each color
- The pattern must start with either Green or Yellow

Calculate the number of possible valid patterns for a given N.
