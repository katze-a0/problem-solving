Basic Geometry Problems
Problem 1: Triangle Hunter
In a 20×20 grid of points with integer coordinates:

Find the number of triangles with vertices on grid points
Area must be exactly 20 square units
All sides must have integer length

Problem 2: Circle Intersection
Given n circles where each circle:

Has integer coordinates for center (x,y)
Has integer radius r
Find the number of points with integer coordinates that lie on exactly two circles.
Input: First 3 circles are: (0,0,5), (5,0,5), (0,5,5)
Consider total 5 circles with coordinates and radii ≤ 10.

Problem 3: Rectangle Rotation
Given a rectangle with:

Width = 6 units
Height = 8 units
Center at origin (0,0)
As it rotates 360°, find the number of integer coordinate points that the perimeter passes through exactly once.
