# Coding Problems - Mathematics and Logic

## Sample Problem (Reference Level)
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
 the first 10 terms will be: 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, . . .
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Similar Difficulty Problems

### Problem 1: Perfect Square Sequence
Given a sequence where each number is formed by adding the previous perfect square:
1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, ...
(Formed by: 1, 1+4, 1+4+9, 1+4+9+16, ...)
Find the sum of all terms in this sequence that are prime numbers and less than 1000.

### Problem 2: Alternating Digit Sum
Consider numbers formed by alternating between adding and multiplying digits:
For example: 2345 = 2 + 3 × 4 + 5 = 19
Find all numbers between 1000 and 9999 where this alternating sum equals the sum of the number's prime factors.
Example: If 1234 has prime factors 2, 617, then sum = 619

### Problem 3: Digital Root Pattern
The digital root of a number is found by continuously summing its digits until a single digit is reached.
Example: 789 → 7+8+9=24 → 2+4=6
Create a sequence where each term is the product of its position and its digital root.
Find the sum of the first 100 terms that are perfect squares.

### Problem 4: Binary Factor Sum
For a positive integer n, consider the sum of numbers formed by its binary factors.
Example: 12 has factors 1,2,3,4,6,12
Their binary forms: 1,10,11,100,110,1100
Sum as integers: 1+2+3+4+6+12=28
Find all numbers between 1 and 100 where this sum is a perfect cube.

### Problem 5: Circular Prime Rotation
A number is a circular prime if all rotations of its digits are prime.
Example: 197 rotations are 197, 971, 719 - all prime
Create a sequence where each term is formed by concatenating two consecutive circular primes.
Example: 197 and 719 form 197719
Find the sum of the first 10 terms in this sequence that are themselves prime.

## Advanced Pythagorean Triplet Problems

### Problem 6: Nested Triplets
A nested Pythagorean triplet is where one number in a triplet forms part of another triplet.
Example: 3-4-5 and 5-12-13 share 5
Find all nested Pythagorean triplets under 1000 where:
- All numbers must be prime
- The shared number must be the hypotenuse of one triplet and a leg of the other
Calculate the product of all unique numbers found.

### Problem 7: Triplet Chains
A Pythagorean triplet chain is formed when the hypotenuse of one triplet equals a leg of the next.
Example: 3-4-5 → 5-12-13 → 13-84-85
Find the longest possible chain where:
- All numbers must be under 1000
- No number can be reused
- The sum of any two adjacent numbers in the chain must be prime

### Problem 8: Complex Triplet Properties
Consider Pythagorean triplets (a,b,c) where:
- The average of a and b is a perfect square
- c is the sum of two prime numbers
- The difference between c and this average is a Fibonacci number
Find all such triplets where a, b, and c are less than 500.
Calculate the sum of all unique values that appear in these triplets.
